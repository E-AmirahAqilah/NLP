In this subsection, we will learn about a useful technique called **term frequency-inverse document frequency** (*tf-idf*) that can be used to downweight those frequently occurring words in the feature vectors. On the other words by tf-idf we can reduce the weightage of more common words like (the, is, an etc.) which occurs in all document.\n","\n","The *tf-idf* can be defined as the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\textit{tf-idf}(t,d) = tf(t,d) \\times idf(t,d)\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","Here the <font color=green><b> *tf(t,d)* </b></font> is the term frequency that equal to **Count of word / Total words, in each document**. The inverse document frequency *idf(t,d)* can be calculated as:\n","\n","\\begin{align}\n","idf(t,d) = log\\frac{n_d}{\\text{df(d,t)}}\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","where <font color=green><b> $n_d$ </b></font> is **the total number of documents**, and <font color=green><b>*df(d,t)*</b></font> is **the number of documents *d* that contain the term t**. Note that the log is used to ensure that low document frequencies are not given too much weight.\n","\n","\n","scikit-learn implements yet another vectorizer, the TfidfVectorizer, that creates feature vectors as tf-idfs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"5b1mBRLhyrqB"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","\n","\n","docs = np.array([\n","    'The sun is shining',\n","    'The weather is sweet',\n","    'The sun is shining and the weather is sweet'])\n","\n","vect2 = TfidfVectorizer().fit(docs)\n","bag2 = vect2.transform(docs)\n","bag2.toarray()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Tye0L6xgyrqC"},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","\n","# Fit the TfidfVectorizer to the training data\n","vect = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=5).fit(X_train)\n","X_train_vectorized = vect.transform(X_train)\n","\n","model = LogisticRegression()\n","model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)\n","\n","predictions = model.predict(vect.transform(X_test))\n","y_proba = model.predict_proba(vect.transform(X_test))\n","\n","print('AUC: ', roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba[:,1]))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9-IHZEgByrqC"},"source":["## <font color=green> Exercise B</font>\n","- Predict two below reviews as negetive or positive using our model:\n","\n","      ['no an issue, phone is working', 'an issue, phone is not working']      "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"IW_kg_ELyrqC"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Your code here\n","x_test = ['no an issue, phone is working', 'an issue, phone is not working']\n","vect.transform(x_test)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mTq6V9TAyrqC"},"source":["# n-grams\n","\n","The sequence of items in the bag-of-words model that we just created is also called the 1-gram or unigram model — each item or token in the vocabulary represents a single word.
